To test our visualization, we used two data sets, one "sfgate.csv" that is included in \href{http://wiresharkbook.com/101_supplements/wireshark101files.zip}{a 330MB zip file} captured by Wireshark published by netresec.com, another is the data provided to us from dell captured by SonicWall firewall. We apply these data directly to the visualization when testing dashboard and datamap, while simulate a server posting data in real-time when testing real-time map plot.
