Visualizing SonicWall Firewall Data
===================================

In this project, students will use D3 to build stand-alone prototype visualizations of Dell SonicWall firewall data that could be integrated into their Dell SonicWall Analyzer product.

## Project Resources ##

This project will use primarily d3.js (or p5.js) for visualization, and any other JavaScript libraries necessary to parse and filter the data. The data will come from the Dell SonicWall line, and the visualizations should extend what is available in their analysis products.

## D3 Resources ##

I especially encourage you to read the following articles by the creator of D3, Mike Bostock:

- [Three Little Circles](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/circles/)
- [Thinking with Joins](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/)
- [How Selections Work](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/)
- [Working with Transitions](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/transition/)
- [Towards Reusable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/)

*Alternatively, you are welcome to look into the new [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) library. It is perfectly acceptable to have some of you working in D3 and some of you working in p5 instead.*
