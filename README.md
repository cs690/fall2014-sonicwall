Visualizing SonicWall Firewall Data
===================================

In this project, students will use D3 to build stand-alone prototype visualizations of Dell SonicWALL firewall data that could be integrated into their Dell SonicWALL Analyzer product.

## Project Team ##

The co-sponsors of this project are:

- Sophie Engle, University of San Francisco
- Carrie Gates, Dell Research

The students participating in this project are:

- Wanzhang Sheng (@ranmocy)
- Michelle Gao (@michellegg)
- Kaiming Yang (@yaxum62)

## Project Timeline ##

| Month     | Description |
|:----------|:------------|
| August    | Project introduction and setup.
| September | Learn D3 and create basic visualizations. |
| October   | Learn SonicWALL data format, and integrate into visualizations. |
| November  | Prepare deliverables for Supercomputing. |
| December  | Present deliverables and results. |

## Project Resources ##

This project will use primarily d3.js (or p5.js) for visualization, and any other JavaScript libraries necessary to parse and filter the data. The data will come from the Dell SonicWALL line, and the visualizations should extend what is available in their analysis products.

## D3 Resources ##

The following are some great resource for getting started:

- <http://d3js.org/>
- <http://alignedleft.com/tutorials/d3>
- <http://bost.ocks.org/mike/>

I especially encourage you to read the following articles by the creator of D3, Mike Bostock:

- [Three Little Circles](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/circles/)
- [Thinking with Joins](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/join/)
- [How Selections Work](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/selection/)
- [Working with Transitions](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/transition/)
- [Towards Reusable Charts](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/chart/)

*Alternatively, you are welcome to look into the new [p5.js](http://p5js.org/) library. It is perfectly acceptable to have some of you working in D3 and some of you working in p5 instead.*

## SonicWall Resources ##

Here are some of the SonicWALL products we will get to work with:

- [Dell SonicWALL TZ Series (Small Business)](http://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/TZ-Series.html)
- [Dell SonicWALL Supermassive Series (Enterprise)](http://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/network-security.html)
- [Dell SonicWALL Analyzer](http://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/Firewall-Analyzer.html)
- [Dell SonicWALL Srutinizer](http://www.sonicwall.com/us/en/products/Firewall-Analyzer.html)

The Scrutinizer has a free trial, but until we have SonicWALL data please do not request one.
