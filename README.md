Visualizing SonicWall Firewall Data
===================================

Students will use D3 to build stand-alone prototype visualizations of Dell SonicWall firewall data that could be integrated into their Dell SonicWall Analyzer product. These prototypes may be highlighted on the Dell SecureWorks blog, and students will have the opportunity to tour the Dell offices and meet members of the new Dell Research team. Prior experience with D3, visualization, and firewalls are a plus but not necessary.
